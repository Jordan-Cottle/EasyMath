NOTES:
    1-18-2018:
        Basic vector operations completed and functioning
    1-26-2019:
        Point, Line, Plane classes operating and all classes now extend an abstract EuclideanObject class
    2-26-2019:
        Working in seperate branch to practice git with working branches in multiple stations
        Building function package to handle operations with functions in multiple variables
        Placed previously constructed classes into objects package to logically differentiate them from the functions 
        Started adding unit tests to classes. Currently only Point class has tests, focus effort on tests before new development to make things easier moving forward
        
TODO:
    Tests:
        Create test bench for classes
        
    Linear Algebra:
        Create LinearEquation class to easily store/print/manipulate equations that correspond to Lines/Planes 
        Create a Matrix class to use matrices to work with linear equations
            -Use to calculate a point for the common line of two intersecting planes
        
    Visual:
        Create a Graph class to visualize objects and equations being worked with
            -choose a 3d to 2d projection scheme
                -use vector projection method from the Vector class to project multidimensional vectors into a 2d plane
                -Draw contour maps for multivariable functions
