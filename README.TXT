PROJECT TITLE: EasyMath
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To translate mathematical concepts learned in class to functioning programs
DATE: 1-26-2018
AUTHORS: Jordan Cottle

NOTES:
    1-18-2018:
        Basic vector operations completed and functioning
    1-26-2019:
        Point, Line, Plane classes operating and all classes now extend an abstract EuclideanObject class
        
TODO:
    Tests:
        Create test bench for classes
        
    Linear Algebra:
        Create LinearEquation class to easily store/print/manipulate equations that correspond to Lines/Planes 
        Create a Matrix class to use matrices to work with linear equations
            -Use to calculate a point for the common line of two intersecting planes
        
    Visual:
        Create a Graph class to visualize objects and equations being worked with
            -choose a 3d to 2d projection scheme
